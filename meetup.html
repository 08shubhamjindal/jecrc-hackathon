          <p><strong>Nagpur</strong> has an extremely limited number of public places which are easily accessible by wheelchair. Sometimes, this could be one of the limiting factors why wheelchair users in the city don't come out from their homes. This group is for everyone who uses a wheelchair, and would like to connect with similar people to share their experiences, discuss tips on day-to-day living activities, motivate each other and last but not the least come out and have fun with people who share similar situations.</p>
